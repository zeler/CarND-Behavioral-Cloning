# CarND Behavioral Cloning Project (P3)

This repository contains starting files for P3, Behavioral Cloning.

### `drive.py`

Usage of `drive.py` requires you have saved the model definition as a JSON file, i.e. `model.json` and the weights as a h5 file, i.e. `model.h5`.

```sh
python drive.py model.json
```

The above command will load the model definition and weights and use the model to make predictions on individual images in real-time and send the predicted angle back to the server via a websocket connection.

#### Saving a video of the autonomous agent

```sh
python drive.py model.json run1
```

The fourth argument `run1` is the directory to save the images seen by the agent to. If the directory already exists it'll be overwritten.

```sh
ls run1

The image file name is a timestamp when the image image was seen. This information is used by `video.py` to create a chronological video of the agent driving.

### `video.py`

```sh
python video.py run1
```

Create a video based on images found in the `run1` directory. The name of the video will be name of the directory following by `'.mp4'`, so, in this case the video will be `run1.mp4`.

Optionally one can specify the FPS (frames per second) of the video:

```sh
python video.py run1 --fps 48
```

The video will run at 48 FPS. The default FPS is 60.

#### Why create a video

1. It's been noted the simulator might perform differently based on the hardware. So if your model drives succesfully on your machine it might not on another machine (your reviewer). Saving a video is a solid backup in case this happens.
2. You could slightly alter the code in `drive.py` and/or `video.py` to create a video of what your model sees after the image is processed (may be helpful for debugging).
